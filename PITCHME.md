### Do it Yourself
You’re driving down the road in your car on a wild and stormy night. The weather is like a hurricane, with heavy rains, high winds, and lightning flashing constantly. While driving, you come across a partially-covered bus stop, and you can see three people waiting for a bus:


+++


- An old woman who looks as if she is about to die.
- An old friend who once saved your life.
- The perfect partner you have been dreaming about (your “soulmate”).

Knowing that you only have room for one passenger in your car (it’s a really small car), which one would you choose to offer a ride to? And why?

+++

## Start thinking!

+++

## “I would give the car keys to my old friend, and let him take the old woman to the hospital. Then I would stay behind and wait for the bus with the partner of my dreams.” - 16 Blocks

### Be confident of your thoughts and be ready to receive feedback and get into arguments

- If you're not confident with your own idea you won't be able to share your ideas to other which in turn lower the possible selection of ideas.
- It doesn't mean that you should keep your own idea even though there's a better one.

### Even though unrelated, ideas from other fields can also be used to solve problems given the correct tweaks.
