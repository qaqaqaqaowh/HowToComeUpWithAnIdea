how to archieve a goal or solve a problem
a thought process
so to come up with an idea we must first identify what is the problem
its like 

1. Knowing your problem
2. Expand your knowledge/experience new stuff, you need to have a broad 	
   knowledge/deep knowledge in related areas
3. Brainstorming course of actions (Bouncing off ideas of other people, 
   leveraging on their knowledge)
4. Think out of the box, it is important that you don't necessarily stick to 
   the norm. Be able to relate to loosely connected concepts.
5. Be confident of your thoughts and be ready to receive feedback and get into 
   arguments
   - If you're not confident with your own idea you won't be able to share your 
     ideas to other which in turn lower the possible selection of ideas.
   - It doesn't mean that you should keep your own idea even though there's a 
     better one.
6. Even though unrelated, ideas from other fields can also be used to solve 
   problems given the correct tweaks.
7. Criterias of good idea includes: 
   - Least negative impacts (Time/Monetary cost)
     - Highest cost to benefit ratio
   - Most comprehensive
   - Has alot of input from various people (Less likely to miss out important 
     points)
   - Bad idea can be used as a reference to come up with a better ideas

Examples:
2. Reading books, travel, watch documentries, talk with other people, share ideas, debate, listen to seminars, watch youtube videos and etc are ways to broaden your horizon and provide you with ammunition to come up with new ideas.

3. Gather around with people that are facing the same problems/have different areas of expertise to provide different perspective and approaches to the same problem and to comment and critique on existing idea.

4. One can missout possible solutions/ways of achieving goals when thinking only in a certain way/area. By thinking out of the box one will no longer be limited to a narrow scope allowing you to create more unexpected solution that maybe better.
